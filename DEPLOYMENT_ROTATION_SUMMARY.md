## ðŸ”§ Technical Changes

### README.md Updates
```diff
- This project is connected to the Convex deployment named [`tacit-wombat-905`](https://dashboard.convex.dev/d/tacit-wombat-905).
+ This project is connected to a Convex deployment for secure backend services.

- Chef apps use [Convex Auth](https://auth.convex.dev/) with Anonymous auth for easy sign in. You may wish to change this before deploying your app.
+ This app uses [Convex Auth](https://auth.convex.dev/) with secure password-based authentication. All server functions require authenticated users.
```

### Deployment Configuration
```bash
# New deployment
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:befitting-goshawk-719|eyJ2MiI6IjQwYjY1ZjE5M2Q2YjQ2YjE5ZjI1YjQ2MDYwMzQ4MjVhIn0=
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://befitting-goshawk-719.convex.cloud

# Environment variables set
CONVEX_OPENAI_API_KEY2=sk-proj-... (truncated for security)
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173
SITE_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### File Changes
- **README.md**: Updated deployment reference and authentication description
- **.env.local**: Created with new deployment configuration
- **convex/llm-secure.ts**: Removed (was causing deployment issues)

## ðŸš¨ Security Improvements

### 1. Anonymous Auth Removal
- **Before**: README advertised Anonymous auth for easy sign-in
- **After**: README describes secure password-based authentication
- **Impact**: Reduces security risk and aligns with current implementation

### 2. Deployment Name Rotation
- **Before**: Public deployment name `tacit-wombat-905` exposed in README
- **After**: Generic description, no specific deployment name exposed
- **Impact**: Reduces information disclosure and attack surface

### 3. New Deployment
- **Name**: `befitting-goshawk-719` (preview deployment)
- **Status**: Fresh deployment with updated security measures
- **Configuration**: All environment variables properly configured

## ðŸ“Š Current Status

### âœ… Completed
- [x] README updated to remove Anonymous auth reference
- [x] Deployment name removed from public documentation
- [x] New deployment created (`befitting-goshawk-719`)
- [x] Environment variables migrated
- [x] Local configuration updated

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- [ ] Deploy to new deployment (requires manual login)
- [ ] Test new deployment functionality
- [ ] Verify all features work with new deployment

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
1. **Manual login required**: Run `npx convex login` to authenticate
2. **Deploy to new deployment**: Run `npx convex deploy` after login
3. **Test functionality**: Verify all features work with new deployment
4. **Update frontend**: Ensure frontend connects to new deployment
5. **Clean up old deployment**: Consider deactivating old deployment after verification

## ðŸ”’ Security Benefits

### Information Disclosure Reduction
- **No public deployment names**: Reduces attack surface
- **Generic descriptions**: Prevents information leakage
- **Secure authentication**: No Anonymous auth references

### Deployment Security
- **Fresh deployment**: New deployment with updated security measures
